# Caches

Cache is a memory that holds a subset of main memory.

Ideal cache would predict with 100% accuracy what data processor will need. 
__hit__ - 


## Temporal and spacial locality
- temporal (related to time). Processor is likely to access the data again soon.
- spatial. Processor is likely to access the adjacent regions of data.


## Direct mapped cache
- Contains sets that are 1 block in size.

## How is main memory mapped to cache?

Address is divided into 3 sections.
[Tag][Set][Byte offset]

- set: decides to which set the data goes
- offset: not taken into account in direct mapped cache
- tag: identifies unique address


## N way associative caches
An N-way set associative cache reduces conflicts by providing N blocks in each set


## Fully associative cache:

[Tag][Set][Block offset][Byte offset]
B-ways. Fewest misses, but the most complex structure.
Can fit an entire block, therefore benefits from spatial locality.

## Who goes out?
LRU _(Least Recently Used)_ policy
