# Always statements:

All signals keep their old value until an event in the sensitivity list takes place that explicitly causes them to change

Example: Flip-flop will have only clk in its sensitivity list, as rising edge of the clock is the only case in which a flip-flop would change its state.

In contrast, ```assign``` statement represents continous assignment and therefore can only describe combinational logic.

# 4 bit register:
```Verilog
module flipflop(input logic d[3:0],
                input logic clk,
                output logic q[3:0])
    always_ff@(posedge clk)
        q <= d;
endmodule
```

# Async resettable register
```Verilog

module flipflop_resettable_async( input logic[3:0] d,
                            input logic clk,
                            input logic rst,
                            output logic[3:0] q)

    always_ff@(posedge clk, rst) // ',' can be used interchangably with 'or'
        if(rst) q <= 4'b0; //q gets 4 zeros
        else q <= d;

endmodule
```

# Sync resettable register
```Verilog

module flipflop_resettable_sync(input logic[3:0] d,
                                input logic clk,
                                input logic rst,
                                output logic[3:0] q)

    always_ff@(posedge clk)
        if(rst) q <= 4'b0;
        else q <= d;

endmodule

# Enabled resettable register
```Verilog

module flipflop_enabled(input logic[3:0] d,
                        input logic clk,
                        input logic en,
                        input logic rst,
                        output logic[4:0] q)

    always_ff@(posedge clk, poedge rst)
        if(rst) q <= 4'b0;
        else if(en) q <= d;

endmodule

# 16-bit counter

```
module 16bit_counter(   input logic in, logic clk, logic rst
