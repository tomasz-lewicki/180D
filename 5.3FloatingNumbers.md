32-bit floating-point uses a bias of 127.

Therefore, an exponent of 7 would be represented:
```
7+127 = 10000110(2)
```

## Implicit leading 1

Because the numbers in binary would be calculate as:

```
(-1)sign x 1.fraction x 2exponent-bias
```

The leading 1 is omitted to give an extra bit of space for the matissa.

## 0 representation problem

Due to the leading implicit one it is problematic to represent zero. There are 4 "special" numbers in IEEE 754 standard.

|Number|Sign|Exponent|Fraction|
|-|-|-|-|
|0|X|00000000|0000000000000000000000000|
|inf|1|11111111|0000000000000000000000000|
|-inf|X|11111111|0000000000000000000000000|
|NaN|X|11111111|X, not zero|

This also means that there is negative and positive zero.

NaN is used for numbers that are not in Real numbers (sqrt(-1), log(-1))
