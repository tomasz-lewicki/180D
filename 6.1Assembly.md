# Assembly language, MIPS 32-bit assembly 

Assembly is a human readibly representation of machine code.

## __constants__ / __immediates__ - numbers whose values are directly available without access to memory.
Immediates are in range [-32 768, 32 767]. 

Example
```as
# $0 = a, $1 = b;
addi $0, $0, 4 # a = a + 4;
addi $1, $1, -99 # b = b -99;
```

# Instruction formats

There are 3 instruction formats in MIPS.
The fields in each type are laid out in such a way that the same fields are always in the same place for each type.

|Type|31-26|25-21|20-16|15-11|10-06|05-00|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|R-Type|opcode|$rs|$rt|$rd|shamt|funct|
|I-Type|opcode|$rs|$rt|immediate|
|J-Type|opcode|address|

rd - _register destination_

rs - _register source_

rt - _register target_

funct - _function_ (e.g. on addition or substraction on ALU)

# R-type instruction:

|opcode|$rs|$rt|$rd|shamt|funct|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|operation code (0 for r-type)|source register 1|source register 2|dest. register|value used in shift operations (0 for r-type) |function (add, sub, multiply, etc.)|

Three registers as operands: two sources and one destination.
```
mnemonic rd, rs, rt
```

Example:
```
add $s1, $s2, $s3 # $s1 = $s2 + $s3
```

# I-type instruction:

|opcode|$rs|$rt|imm|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|operation code (0 for r-type)|source register 1|__sometimes__ used as source register 2 (```sw```) and sometimes as destination register (```addi```, ```lw```)] |immediate|

## Examples:

Add imediate
```asm
addi $s0, $s1, 5 # s1 = s0 +5
lw $s3, -24($s4) # load a value with -24 byte offset from $s4
```

Branch equal _(only jumps if condition is met)_
```
beq $t0 $t1 myLabel
```

load word
```asm
lw $s3, 1($0) #read word from address ($0 + 1 = 1) in memory into register s3 
```

store word
```
sw $s7, 5($0) #store word from register s7 into memory location with address 5.
```

# J-type instructions

# Endianness

_little endian_ - bytes stored starting from the smallest one.
_big endian_ - opposite

Suppose, we store 0x7d3d2a1b number between addresses a and a+3.

In little endian:
```
a+0 <- 1b
a+1 <- 2a
a+2 <- 3d
a+3 <- 7d
```

In big endian:
```
a+0 <- 7d
a+1 <- 3d
a+2 <- 2a
a+3 <- 1b
```

# Branching
execution of instructions out of sequence

Types:
- conditional (e.g. for if statements)
    + branch if equal (beg)
    + branch if not equal (bne)
- unconditional
    + jump ```j```
    + jump register ```jr```
    + jump and link ```jal```

# Reading assembly

```assembly
addi $s0, $0, 4     # $s0 = 0 + 4 (=4)
addi $s1, $0, 1     # $s1 = 0 + 1 (=1)
sll  $s1, $s1, 2    # $s1 << 2  (=4) 
```
