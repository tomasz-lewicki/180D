# MIPS 32-bit assembly 

## Instruction format

There are 3 main instruction formats in MIPS. The fields in each type are laid out in such a way that the same fields are always in the same place for each type.

|Type|31-26|25-21|20-16|15-11|10-06|05-00|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|R-Type|opcode|$rs|$rt|$rd|shamt|funct|
|I-Type|opcode|$rs|$rt|immediate|
|J-Type|opcode|address|

rd - _register destination_

rs - _register source_

rt - _register target_

funct - _function_ (e.g. on addition or substraction on ALU)

## R-type instruction:
```
mnemonic rd, rs, rt
```

Example:
```
add $s1, $s2, $s3
```

## J-type instruction:

Jump:

```
j myLabel  #jump instruction
```

Branch equal _(only jumps if condition is met)_
```
beq $t0 $t1 myLabel
```

Notice that there's only 26 bits for label left - we cannot encode an entire address. The label is shifted left two times (in order to convert from words to bytes). You end up with something like this:
```
0000[myLabel]00
```
J-type instrucions give you max of 256MB of range

# Examples:

load word
```asm
lw $s3, 1($0) #read word from address ($0 + 1 = 1) in memory into register s3 
```

store word
```
sw $s7, 5($0) #store word from register s7 into memory location with address 5.
```

# Endianness

_little endian_ - bytes stored starting from the smallest one.
_big endian_ - opposite

Suppose, we store 0x7d3d2a1b number between addresses a and a+3.

In little endian:
```
a+0 <- 1b
a+1 <- 2a
a+2 <- 3d
a+3 <- 7d
```

In big endian:
```
a+0 <- 7d
a+1 <- 3d
a+2 <- 2a
a+3 <- 1b
