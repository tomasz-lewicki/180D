# Timing of sequential logic

**clock skew** - variation time of system's clock reaching different gates in the circuit

**interfacing with outside world async signals** - use synchronizer. You never know at what time the monkey is gonna press a button

**contamination delay** - time from a change in logic level of input to any of the outputs **starts** to change. This does not mean reaching the final state.

**propagation delay** - time from a change in logic input to reaching the final stable state at the output


**aperture time**, _ta_ - stable state required while sampling _(around the edge of the clock)_.

```
ta = ts + th
```

**setup time**, _ts_ - stable state required before the edge of the clock to capture the right results

**hold time**, _th_ - stable state required after the edge of the clock
